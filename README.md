# Automated-Defects-Identification-System-in-Printed-Circuit-Boards-Using-CNN
Automated Defects Identification in Printed Circuit Boards using Deep learning Techniques. Mainly target the manufacturing plants. this is helps to identify the defects of the pcbs and minimize the defects of the production and increase the profits of the compnay. 
step 01 - Downloard pcb-defect-detection file and run it. need to downloard the exact libraries to the platform.
step 02 - create pcbdetection.PT and downloard it. 
step 03 - make a new folder and create a path and open cmd on that exact path. 
step 04 - pip install inference-sdk pillow, open-cv python and defect_detectorapp.
